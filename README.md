# Scrimba Firebase Mobile Application

This project is a tutorial delivered by Rafid Hoda at Scrimba. I'm working through this tutorial to expand my knowledge in JavaScript and Firebase realtime database.

**Brief:**
* Build a JavaScript mobile application that allows users to write a shopping list that has CRUD features.
* Build on the basic application to learn more about developing JS apps whilst learning the features of Firebase.
